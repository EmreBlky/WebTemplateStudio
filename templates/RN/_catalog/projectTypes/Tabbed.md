# Tab navigation
Possibly the most common style of navigation in mobile apps is tab-based navigation. This can be tabs on the bottom of the screen or on the top below the header (or even instead of a header).

We use [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) for routing and navigation in your React Native apps.

### Easy to Use
Start quickly with built-in navigators that deliver a seamless out-of-the-box experience.
### Components built for iOS and Android
Platform-specific look-and-feel with smooth animations and gestures.
### Completely customizable
If you know how to write apps using JavaScript you can customize any part of React Navigation.
### Extensible platform
React Navigation is extensible at every layerâ€” you can write your own navigators or even replace the user-facing API.
