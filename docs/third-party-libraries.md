# 3rd party libraries updates and breaking changes

Web Template Studio generated projects include 3rd party libraries and references. These dependencies will inevitably be updated and changed over time.

The following points define how such changes will be handled.

* Web Template Studio will aim to update to the latest versions of referenced libraries as quickly as possible.
* Where a referenced library introduces a breaking change, the templates will be adapted to incorporate such a change.
* Any major changes to templates will be recorded in the release notes for the Web Template Studio release that incorporates the changes.
* Web Template Studio will use fixed versions for dependencies to ensure that new library versions do not break generated apps.
